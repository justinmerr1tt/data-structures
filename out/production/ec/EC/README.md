3.1: Hours were spent laboring away, I supsect there is some kind of infinite loop being put into place as the value 1102 is printed three times, and through troubleshooting I discovered that the program is not changing the array. To fix this in the future I think more time needs to be spent (possibly learning how to use a debugger) to figure out the point(s) that are causing this error with this input alone. Note that the program cannot handle indices out of range in all situations (e.g. it can for situations related to a relative index), yet this can be fixed by checking every index prior to accesining, and if it is out of range adding enough indices to encompass it.
Answer: nothing, 1102 repeats x3, array not changing; input program: 1102,34463338,34463338,63,1007,63,34463338,63,1005,63,53,1102,1,3,1000,109,988,209,12,9,1000,209,6,209,3,203,0,1008,1000,1,63,1005,63,65,1008,1000,2,63,1005,63,904,1008,1000,0,63,1005,63,58,4,25,104,0,99,4,0,104,0,99,4,17,104,0,99,0,0,1102,1,21,1004,1101,28,0,1016,1101,0,27,1010,1102,36,1,1008,1102,33,1,1013,1101,0,22,1012,1101,0,37,1011,1102,34,1,1017,1102,466,1,1027,1102,1,484,1029,1102,1,699,1024,1102,1,1,1021,1101,0,0,1020,1102,1,24,1015,1101,0,473,1026,1101,653,0,1022,1102,26,1,1007,1102,25,1,1006,1101,0,39,1014,1102,646,1,1023,1101,690,0,1025,1102,1,29,1019,1101,32,0,1018,1101,30,0,1002,1101,0,20,1001,1102,1,38,1005,1102,1,23,1003,1101,0,31,1000,1101,35,0,1009,1101,0,493,1028,109,5,1208,0,37,63,1005,63,201,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,203,4,187,1002,64,2,64,109,-4,2107,36,8,63,1005,63,223,1001,64,1,64,1105,1,225,4,209,1002,64,2,64,109,18,21107,40,41,-9,1005,1010,243,4,231,1105,1,247,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,6,21107,41,40,-9,1005,1016,267,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,269,4,253,1002,64,2,64,109,-19,21102,42,1,5,1008,1011,42,63,1005,63,291,4,275,1105,1,295,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,15,1205,0,309,4,301,1105,1,313,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,-27,2101,0,9,63,1008,63,20,63,1005,63,333,1106,0,339,4,319,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,19,21102,43,1,6,1008,1019,45,63,1005,63,363,1001,64,1,64,1105,1,365,4,345,1002,64,2,64,109,1,21108,44,47,-3,1005,1011,385,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,387,4,371,1002,64,2,64,109,-22,1201,9,0,63,1008,63,21,63,1005,63,411,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,413,4,393,1002,64,2,64,109,9,1207,0,19,63,1005,63,433,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,435,4,419,1002,64,2,64,109,-9,2107,30,8,63,1005,63,453,4,441,1105,1,457,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,25,2106,0,10,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,475,4,463,1002,64,2,64,109,11,2106,0,0,4,481,1001,64,1,64,1105,1,493,1002,64,2,64,109,-18,2108,21,-6,63,1005,63,511,4,499,1106,0,515,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,-12,2108,18,6,63,1005,63,535,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,537,4,521,1002,64,2,64,109,19,21101,45,0,-7,1008,1010,45,63,1005,63,563,4,543,1001,64,1,64,1105,1,563,1002,64,2,64,109,-10,1207,-5,31,63,1005,63,581,4,569,1106,0,585,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,-8,2102,1,5,63,1008,63,21,63,1005,63,611,4,591,1001,64,1,64,1105,1,611,1002,64,2,64,109,5,1201,0,0,63,1008,63,21,63,1005,63,633,4,617,1106,0,637,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,13,2105,1,6,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,655,4,643,1002,64,2,64,109,-7,1202,-3,1,63,1008,63,26,63,1005,63,681,4,661,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,681,1002,64,2,64,109,12,2105,1,2,4,687,1001,64,1,64,1105,1,699,1002,64,2,64,109,-28,1208,8,30,63,1005,63,717,4,705,1106,0,721,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,10,1202,1,1,63,1008,63,40,63,1005,63,745,1001,64,1,64,1105,1,747,4,727,1002,64,2,64,109,10,21108,46,46,-2,1005,1012,765,4,753,1105,1,769,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,-2,1205,8,781,1106,0,787,4,775,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,-9,2101,0,0,63,1008,63,23,63,1005,63,809,4,793,1105,1,813,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,9,1206,8,831,4,819,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,831,1002,64,2,64,109,-9,2102,1,-2,63,1008,63,22,63,1005,63,855,1001,64,1,64,1106,0,857,4,837,1002,64,2,64,109,4,21101,47,0,10,1008,1017,50,63,1005,63,877,1105,1,883,4,863,1001,64,1,64,1002,64,2,64,109,18,1206,-4,895,1105,1,901,4,889,1001,64,1,64,4,64,99,21101,0,27,1,21102,915,1,0,1106,0,922,21201,1,56639,1,204,1,99,109,3,1207,-2,3,63,1005,63,964,21201,-2,-1,1,21102,1,942,0,1106,0,922,22102,1,1,-1,21201,-2,-3,1,21101,0,957,0,1106,0,922,22201,1,-1,-2,1106,0,968,22102,1,-2,-2,109,-3,2106,0,0
